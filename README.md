# Integrated_Design_Project

This was part of 2nd year project, where the team built an autonomous robot using arduino and computer vision. In this task
we build a robot to demonstrate the collection, detection and delivery of blocks to a high degree of
precision in a structured environment.

The team was: Ioan Webber, Helen Gao, Edward Hu, Kohei Watanabe, Adhithya Saravanan and Ognjen Stefanovic![Robot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72799142/159185592-883267df-7676-419f-8319-90aa01999d84.PNG)
